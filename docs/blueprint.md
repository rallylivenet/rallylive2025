# **App Name**: RallyLive Net

## Core Features:

- Rally Slider: Display a slider on the homepage showing current live rallies, previous rallies, and rally plates (images) from rallylive.net, formatted to a minimum dimension of 720x360.
- Live Stage Information: Show live stage information (e.g., stage name, distance, winner of stage, leader of the rally, current time and position of a certain driver) based on API data.
- Rally Navigation: Provide links or navigation to separate pages or sections for each rally event listed in the API source (rallylive.net).
- AI-Powered Rally Updates: Employ a generative AI tool to summarize stage results and generate rally updates for each event.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) to convey professionalism and reliability, like the dependability of a race-car's engineering.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), to avoid eye strain during long hours of watching races.
- Accent color: Bright Red (#DC2626), a classic auto-racing color that draws the user's attention to key details like driver names and times.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. 
- Prioritize displaying live data clearly and concisely. Use card-based layouts for rally events and stage results.
- Employ sport-style iconography for rally stages, results, and calendar events. Icons should be easily recognizable and related to auto racing (checkered flag, timers, route maps).
- Subtle animations on data updates (stage times, leaderboards) to indicate changes.
